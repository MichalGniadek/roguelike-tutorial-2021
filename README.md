# General
This is a repository for a basic roguelike game following [/r/roguelikedev annual roguelike tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).
It's written in Rust with Bevy game engine and I'm using the tutorial as a rough roadmap.
## Running
Download this repository and just use standard ``cargo run``. You will need to have Rust installed.
