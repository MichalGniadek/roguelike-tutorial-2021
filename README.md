# General
This is a repository for a basic roguelike game following [/r/roguelikedev annual roguelike tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).
It's written in Rust with Bevy game engine and I'm using the tutorial as a rough roadmap.

## Running
Requires Rust and cargo make (can be installed using `cargo install cargo-make`).
Use `cargo make run` to run a desktop version and `cargo make serve` to build web version and start a local web server (the second command will also install a few additional dependencies).
